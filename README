The analysis contains two parts: A set of bash scripts driving CDO 1.9.5 commands and jupyter notebooks

The CDO commands are organized using bash scripts, and are submitted to a compute node by submit_analysis.sh. The do the following:
  - concatenate NetCDF files: analysis_CDO/merge.sh and analysis_CDO/merge_3D.sh 
  - domain-mean timeseries: analysis_CDO/compute_fldmean.sh 
  - condidtional timeseries: analysis_CDO/compute_fldmean_lnd.sh
  - Ensmeble mean for the last 50 days: analysis_CDO/compute_ensmean.sh -> 3D fields
  - Precipitation statistics: analysis_CDO/precip_stats.sh

    Some of the fields were plotted using NCL 6.4: Fig. 1 and Fig 2 (plot_NCL)

The more complex analysis and the plots were done in Python 3.6.5.7 using Jupyter notebooks:
  - The employed Python packages include:
    matplotlib v. 3.1.1, xarray v. 0.12.2, numpy 1.15.1, skimage 0.15.0, scipy v. 1.1.0
